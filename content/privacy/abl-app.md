The Android Baseball League is a real app about a fake league created for the [Pragmatic Bookshelf](https://pragprog.com/) title ["Kotlin and Android Development featuring Jetpack"](https://pragprog.com/titles/mfjetpack/kotlin-and-android-development-featuring-jetpack/).

The app is not really intended for public use though you're perfectly welcome to download it. I _am_ using Firebase Crashlytics/Analytics on the app, so if you're not a fan of those, don't feel welcome to download the app.

Past those libraries, though, the only communication happening with an outside server is the ABL API server which houses basic settings and the ability to send push notifications. Nothing terribly exciting.
