**Passcode Practice** is a simple app to help people remember passcodes and PINs.  No data is being stored by the app itself to any servers, and the entered passcodes are _definitely_ not being saved (because that would be rude).

If you have any concerns about the app, check the source code out on [GitHub](https://github.com/MFazio23/PasscodePractice).

If you _still_ have any concerns, send me a note at [passcodepractice@mfazio.dev](mailto:passcodepractice@mfazio.dev) and let me know.
