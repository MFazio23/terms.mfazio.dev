There should be a bunch of legal info in here, except the app _shouldn't_ require anything like that.

There are no accounts, nothing is going to a server, and there is no identifiable information being used with the app.  Also, the entered passcodes will definitely not be saved, so you're safe there.


If you have any concerns about the app, check the source code out on [GitHub](https://github.com/MFazio23/PasscodePractice).

If you _still_ have any concerns, send me a note at [passcodepractice@mfazio.dev](mailto:passcodepractice@mfazio.dev) and let me know.

The Pound/Hash icon used for the app logo was created by the excellent [Austin Andrews](https://twitter.com/templarian).
